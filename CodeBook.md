# Code Book
## Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data
### Course Project

Note that the full description of the features is found from `features_info.txt` included in the original dataset. This codebook contains  mainly the information relevant to the contents of the repository.

## Data Set

The data set is obtainable at:
[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

### Transformations

1. Mergin of training and test sets were performed using `rbind` and `cbind`
2. Only the mean and standard deviation were extracted from the data set using `grepl` on `"mean()|std()"`. As a result, 79 features were filtered from the original data.  
3. Activity names were replaced with more understandable labels instead of the original integer coding. The functions `gsub` and `sapply` were used for this.
4. A second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was created.

### Identifiers
* `subject`
  Subject identifier (integer) [1:30]
* `activity`
	Activity identifier: 
	- `WALKING` (value = `1`): subject was walking during the test
	- `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (value = `2`): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
	- `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value = `3`): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
	- `SITTING` (value = `4`): subject was sitting during the test
	- `STANDING` (value = `5`): subject was standing during the test
	- `LAYING` (value = `6`): subject was laying down during the test
